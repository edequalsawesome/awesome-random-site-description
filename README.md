== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/super-swank-random-description-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Gutenberg editor to add the 'Super-Swank Random Description' block to your pages or templates
4. Add as many taglines as you'd like, and the block will cycle through them randomly

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I control which tagline shows up? =

The plugin is designed to select taglines randomly, ensuring all taglines are shown before repeating any. You cannot control which specific tagline appears on a specific page load.

= Will the same visitor see different taglines? =

Yes, every time the page refreshes or when a visitor navigates to a different page and back, they'll likely see a different tagline.

= Can I style each tagline differently? =

Currently, all taglines in a single block share the same styling. However, you can add multiple instances of the block with different styling if needed.

= Does this work with any theme? =

Yes, the Super-Swank Random Description Block is designed to work with any WordPress theme that supports Gutenberg blocks.

= Can I use HTML in my taglines? =

For security reasons, the plugin escapes HTML content. You can use the block's formatting options for styling instead.
